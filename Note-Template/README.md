# Note-Template Directory

This directory provides structured templates for taking organized and effective notes during Capture The Flag (CTF) events or security exercises. Using a consistent template helps in systematically documenting findings, steps taken, commands executed, and flags obtained, which is invaluable for writing detailed writeups afterwards and for personal reference.

## Contents

This directory contains templates in various formats for CTF note-taking:

-   **CTFs-Notes-Template-Obsidian.md**: A Markdown template designed for use with Obsidian, a popular note-taking application. It includes sections for Information Gathering, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, and more.
-   **CTFs-Notes-Template-Obsidian.pdf**: A PDF version of the Obsidian note-taking template, suitable for printing or viewing.
-   **CTFs-Note-Template-Obsidian.png**: An image file, likely a screenshot or visual guide related to the Obsidian note-taking template.

Using these templates can help structure your notes during CTFs, making it easier to recall information, track progress, and ultimately create comprehensive writeups.
