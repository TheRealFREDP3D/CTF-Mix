# HTB Broken Shell Investigation - Thought Process

This document summarizes the investigation into the broken shell challenge, detailing the steps taken, payloads tested, observed server responses, and conclusions drawn.

## Initial Analysis

The task was to run the provided Python script `HTB-Broken-Shell/Script-1.py` and investigate the server's response to different payloads. The script connects to a remote server and sends a predefined list of commands, capturing the output.

The initial run of the script revealed a strict character filter on the server: `^[0-9${}/?"[:space:]:&>_=()]+$`. This significantly restricts the types of commands that can be sent.

Observed behaviors from initial payloads:
- Many basic commands resulted in "command not found" or syntax errors.
- Arithmetic expansion `$(())` processed numbers but treated the result as a command.
- Variable expansion `$(($VAR))` and `${VAR}` for environment variables failed with "Command contains disallowed characters".
- `${?}` successfully expanded to the exit status (0).
- Globs `?` and `??` expanded to `_` and `__`.
- Payloads using `/???/??` and `/???/???` seemed to resolve to `/bin/cp` and `/bin/awk` respectively, but execution attempts resulted in errors like "Invalid operation" or "Read-only file system".
- Redirection (`>`) attempts also led to `/bin/cp` errors and read-only file system issues.

## Strategy Development

Given the restrictions, the strategy focused on leveraging the allowed characters and observed behaviors:
- Identify the commands resolved by `/???/??` and `/???/???`.
- Explore ways to use these commands or other allowed characters for information disclosure or command execution.
- Investigate the behavior of allowed special characters like `:`, `&`, `>`, `=`, `()`.

Identified commands:
- `/???/??` likely resolves to `/bin/cp`.
- `/???/???` likely resolves to `/bin/awk`.

Attempts to use `/bin/awk` with glob `?` and filename `_` failed with "Invalid operation /bin/awk".
Attempt to redirect `${?}` to file `_` failed, as the redirection was not interpreted correctly.
Attempt to assign `/???/???` to `_` and execute `$_` resulted in no output.

## Current State

The last attempted action was to add a payload `:` to the script to test if it acts as a null command. However, the user denied the file modification.

The `HTB-Broken-Shell/Script-1.py` file is currently in the state before the last attempted modification.

The next step is to find an alternative way to test the `:` payload or re-evaluate the approach based on the current understanding of the broken shell and the allowed characters.

## Cycle 2: Testing Null Command and Subshell

**Payloads Tested:**
- `:`
- `(:)`

**Observed Responses:**
- `:` resulted in no error and returned the prompt, indicating it's likely a null command.
- `(:)` also resulted in no error and returned the prompt, confirming subshell syntax is recognized and a null command within a subshell is a no-op.

**Analysis:**
The `:` character functions as a null command. The `()` characters for subshells are recognized. Combining these (`(:)`) also works without error. This suggests the shell parses basic command and grouping syntax.

**Next Payload Plan:**
Attempt to use the identified `/???/??` (likely `/bin/cp`) with glob-expanded filenames `_` and `__` as arguments: `/???/?? _ __`. This tests if we can execute `cp` with valid arguments using the globbed paths.
