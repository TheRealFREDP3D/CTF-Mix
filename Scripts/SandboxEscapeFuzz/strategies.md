To exploit a broken shell with the allowed character set `^[0-9${}/?"[:space:]:&>_=()]+$`, we need to craft payloads that bypass the restriction of not being able to use **letters** (both lowercase and uppercase). The goal is to **read a file like `flag.txt`** without violating the character constraints.

---

### üîç Key Observations

- **Allowed Characters**: Digits (`0-9`), `$`, `{`, `}`, `/`, `?`, `"`, space, `:`, `&`, `>`, `_`, `=`, `(`, `)`.
- **Disallowed Characters**: All **letters** (a-z, A-Z), including those in common command names like `cat`, `echo`, or `ls`.
- **Wildcard Matching**: The `?` character matches **any single character**, which allows us to **match file and directory names without typing their actual letters**.
- **Glob Expansion**: In shells like Bash, `/???/???` can expand to `/bin/cat` if `cat` is the first 3-character file in `/bin`.

---

### üß† Strategy Overview

We can **exploit wildcard expansion** to:
1. **Access the `cat` command** using `/???/???` (which expands to `/bin/cat` if `/bin` is the first 3-character directory and `cat` is the first 3-character file in it).
2. **Access the `flag.txt` file** using `?????????` (9 `?` characters, assuming `flag.txt` is 9 characters long including the dot).

This approach avoids using any letters in the input, thus complying with the character restriction.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Example Payload

```bash
/???/??? ?????????
```

#### Breakdown:
- `/???/???`:
  - Matches `/bin/cat` if `/bin` is the first 3-character directory and `cat` is the first 3-character file in it.
- `?????????`:
  - Matches `flag.txt` (9 characters long), assuming it's the only file that fits this pattern in the current directory.

This payload will execute `/bin/cat flag.txt` without using any letters, relying entirely on shell globbing.

---

### üß™ Additional Considerations

- **Path Variations**:
  - If `/bin/cat` is not accessible, try `/usr/bin/cat` using `/???/???/???`.
- **Filename Length**:
  - Adjust the number of `?` characters based on the actual length of `flag.txt`. For example, `flag.txt` has 9 characters (`f l a g . t x t`), so `?????????` works.
- **Multiple Files**:
  - If there are multiple files that match the pattern, the glob might expand to more than one, causing the command to fail. Ensure `flag.txt` is the only file matching the pattern.

---

### üß© Alternative Techniques (If Wildcards Fail)

If wildcard-based globbing fails due to multiple matches or different paths, consider:

- **Using Environment Variables**:
  - Some shells allow referencing built-in variables like `$IFS` (Internal Field Separator), which can be used to construct spaces or other delimiters.
- **Command Substitution**:
  - Use `$()` to execute subcommands. For example:
    ```bash
    $(/???/??? ?????????)
    ```
    This wraps the previous payload in a command substitution, which might help in certain contexts.

- **Variable Assignment**:
  - Assign parts of the command to variables using allowed characters:
    ```bash
    a=/???/???
    b=?????????
    $a $b
    ```

### ‚úÖ Final Payload (Robust Version)

```bash
/???/??? ?????????
```

This payload is concise, adheres strictly to the allowed character set, and leverages wildcard expansion to bypass the letter restriction.

### üßæ Summary

| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Wildcard Matching** | Use `?` to match unknown characters in command and file names |
| **Glob Expansion** | `/???/???` expands to `/bin/cat` in many environments |
| **Filename Matching** | `?????????` matches `flag.txt` (9 characters) |
| **No Letters Used** | Entirely avoids a-z/A-Z, complying with the regex restriction |

This method is effective in scenarios where the shell expands wildcards and the target file has a predictable length.
